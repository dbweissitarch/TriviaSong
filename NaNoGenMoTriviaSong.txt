Did you know about Vlado Taneski ?
It turns out that Vlado Taneski was a Macedonian journalist/crime reporter who was also a serial killer himself. He reported on his own crimes and eventually got caught because he wrote articles on the murders with information that had not yet been released and only the killer would have known. All in all, he killed three 55+ aged women after strangling, torturing, and raping them. He was arrested in 2008 after his DNA was matched to semen found on the victims. After less than a month in prison, he was found dead in his shared prison cell. He was found drowned in a plastic bucket of water and in the absence of other evidence, his death was ruled a suicide.

Did you know about Bees?
It turns out that Serial killers act similarly to bees. Serial killers commit a crime near their home, but far enough to prevent arousing suspicion. Similarly, bees collect pollen near their hive, but far enough from predators. Scientists found algorithms from studying bee behavior to catch felons.

Did you know about Chinese language?
It turns out that Since most people in Japan and China use their phones or computers to phonetically convert the Latin alphabet to type Chinese characters, more people are forgetting how to write some characters by hand. On a Chinese TV show, only 30% of participants could write "toad", 癞蛤蟆 (Lài há ma).

Did you know about Canadian Residential Schools?
It turns out that For over 100 years, Canada forced as many as 150,000 Indigenous children to attend Residential schools away from their families years at a time with the intent of assimilating them and removing their family’s culture. The quality of instruction was sub-par, many children were physically, sexually, and mentally abused and at least 4000 children died in the school system. Most returned home unable to help, or connect with their families.

Did you know about James Watt?
It turns out that James Watt did not invent the steam engine, nor were his ideas on steam engine power inspired by a kettle lid pressured open by steam. Watt improved upon the already commercially successful Newcomen atmospheric engine in the 1760s and 1770s, making certain improvements critical to its future usage, particularly the external condenser, increasing its efficiency, and later the mechanism for transforming reciprocating motion into rotary motion; his new steam engine later gained huge fame as a result.

Did you know about Kangaroo Myth?
It turns out that Kangaroos don’t actually lure predators into the water to drown them. Like many herbivores, when threatened they flee into the water in the hope of not being followed. It’s just that if they're followed, “they’ve got strong arms and big claws and they can drown” a dog-sized pursuer.

Did you know about Agustina of Aragon?
It turns out that Agustina of Aragon was en route to a fort to deliver apples to the Spanish soldiers during the Spanish War of Independence when she found them fleeing in the face of a French attack. She ran ahead and manned the cannons, shaming the soldiers so badly that they felt compelled to return to the fight. With her assistance, they drove off the French. She was eventually captured, but escaped and became a leader of a band of guerilla fighters. She even served as a battery commander in the Battle of Victoria. They called her the Spanish Joan of Arc.
