 NaNoGenMo Trivia Song Generator

I am writing a Node.js app that generates a song about Trivia along the lines of the 12 Days of Christmas. 

Here is an example of the first few stanzas:

And now the song:
The Internet is a magical place in the knowledge space, so what did I learn today?
Did you know about Horton Hears a Who!?
It turns out that Horton Hears a Who!, by Dr. Seuss, is an allegory for post-World War 2 US occupation of Japan. Seuss, who was vehemently anti-Japanese during the conflict, had a drastic change of heart after visiting postwar Japan. He dedicated the book to a Japanese friend.

So now I know about:
Horton Hears a Who! 

The Internet is a magical place in the knowledge space, so what did I learn today?
Did you know about $3 bills ?
It turns out that The city of Detroit has its own local currency, fully backed by U.S. currency. It's printed in $3 bills and features the Spirit of Detroit over the Detroit Skyline.

So now I know about:
Horton Hears a Who! and,
$3 bills  

The Internet is a magical place in the knowledge space, so what did I learn today?
Did you know about Bryan Cranston?
It turns out that Bryan Cranston, at the age of 12, encountered a young Charles Manson while riding horses with his teenage cousin. This happened about a year before Manson committed the Tate-LaBianca murders.
